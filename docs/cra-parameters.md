# CRA Tax Parameters Reference (1990–2026)

> Verifiable historical and current Canadian tax parameters used by this application.
> All values sourced from `src/data/historicalAssumptions.ts` (1990–2025) and `src/store/defaults.ts` (2026 base).

## How to Use This Document

This document lists every CRA tax parameter used in the engine, organized by category and grouped into **eras** — periods where the structural rules (number of brackets, inclusion rates, etc.) remained stable. Within each era, a table gives per-year values.

- **Historical years (1990–2025):** Values are hard-coded from CRA publications and injected as overrides. Auto-indexing is disabled for these years.
- **Future years (2027+):** The engine auto-indexes 2026 base values by cumulative inflation (ITA s. 117.1). Users can override any year.
- **2026 base values** come from `src/store/defaults.ts` and reflect enacted or estimated parameters.

To verify a value, find the year in the relevant table, then check it against the CRA URL or ITA section listed in the [Source Index](#source-index).

## 1. Federal Brackets & Basic Personal Amount

### Era 1: Three-Bracket System (1990–2000)

## 2. Ontario Provincial Brackets & Basic Personal Amount

### Era 1: Percentage of Federal Tax (1990–1999)

Before 2000, Ontario tax was calculated as a percentage of basic federal tax, not on its own bracket system. The rates shown here are the **effective bracket rates** the engine uses to approximate this system.
